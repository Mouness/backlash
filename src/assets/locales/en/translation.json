By examining the tension between central authority and subnational autonomy, we aim to uncover how federal theories and structures can both mitigate and exacerbate these retrogressive trends. The project combines legal analysis, political science, and sociology to provide a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics in the 21st century.",
        "objectives": "Our primary objectives are threefold: 1) To conduct a comparative constitutional analysis of five key jurisdictions (Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Brazil, India); 2) To identify the specific legal mechanisms used by populist movements to erode democratic norms at the subnational level; and 3) To propose robust legal and policy frameworks that strengthen federal resilience and protect fundamental human rights against authoritarian encroachment.",
